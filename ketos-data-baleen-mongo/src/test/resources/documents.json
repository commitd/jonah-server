Hawking was 76 years old. His children released the following statement: \"We are deeply saddened that our beloved father passed away today. He was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years. His courage and persistence with his brilliance and humour inspired people across the world. He once said, 'It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love.' We will Stephen Hawking during a flight aboard a modified Boeing 727 aircraft in 2007. miss him forever.\" Image: Jim Campbell/Aero-News Network. Astronomer royal Lord Rees said of Hawking, \"Stephen was far from being the archetypal unworldy or nerdish scientist. His personality remained amazingly unwarped by his frustrations[...] Few, if any, of Einstein’s successors have done more to deepen our insights into gravity, space and time.\" Hawking studied at Oxford and Cambridge Universities and was in 1979 awarded a post once held by Isaac Newton, the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics. His scientific work focused on fundamental aspects of the universe and space, including black holes. The heat emitted from black holes is called Hawking radiation after him. He was also known for placing bets with other researchers about who would disprove whose theories, as with one he lost to John Preskill, over whether black holes can permanently remove information from the universe — Hawking conceded they probably cannot. Hawking was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also called Lou Gherig's disease, as a young man and spent much of his life in a wheelchair. Doctors predicted he would not live to be 25. Since losing the use of his voice after a tracheotomy in 1985, Hawking communicated with a compute-raided speech system. Hawking maintained a public image to an extent that drew criticism from some of his peers. He became widely known to the general public for his 1988 book, A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes, and has made cameo appearances on many popular television shows, including The Simpsons, Star Trek: The Next Generation, and The Big Bang Theory. He was also the subject of the 2014 biopic The Theory of Everything. \"Not since Albert Einstein has a scientist so captured the public imagination and endeared himself to tens of millions of people around the world,\" fellow physicist Michio Kaku of the City University of New York was quoted by the New York Times. Despite many other honors, including the Wolf Prize, Albert Einstein award, and Fundamental Physics prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom from U.S. President Barack Obama and being named a Commander of the British Empire, Stephen Hawking was not awarded a Nobel Prize. He explained, \"The Nobel is given only for theoretical work that has been confirmed by observation. It is very, very difficult to observe the things I have worked on.\" In a 1989 remark to Der Speigel, Hawking observed, \"We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star[...] But we can understand the universe. That makes us something very special.\" Hawking is survived by his three children, Luc,y Robert, and Tim, and three grandchildren. \n       \n     \n     \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n     \n       \n       \n        \n       \n     \n     \n    \n     \n       \n       \n        \n       \n     \n     \n    \n     \n       \n       \n        \n       \n     \n     \n    \n     \n       \n       \n       Sources Dennis Overbye. \"Stephen Hawking, Who Examined the Universe and Explained Black Holes, Dies at 7\" 6— New York Times, March 14, 2018 Ian Sample. \"Stephen Hawking, science's brightest sta,r dies aged 76\" — The Guardian, March 14, 2018 Sam Byford. \"Pioneering physicist Stephen Hawking dies at 76\" — The Verge, March 14, 2018 Dan Vergano. \"Stephen Hawking, legendary physicist, dies at 76, family say\"s — USA Today, March 14, 2018 Retrieved from \"https://en.wikinews.org/w/index.php? title=British_scientist_Stephen_Hawking_dies_aged_76&oldid=439128\"3 This page was last edited on 19 March 2018, at 12:56.

The changes mean Xi Jinping may be President for life if he so chooses. The vote in the legislature was nearly unanimous. 2958 votes were cast in favor, two opposed, three abstained. Without this change, Xi would be required to leave office in 2023. thought\", as the theory is also known, was approved by theC ommunist Party of China in the autumn of 2017. Shen Chunyao, the chairperson for the Commission for Legislative Affairs of the NPC, told Xinhua News Agency, \"As an important content of the amendment, the inclusion of Xi's thought into the country's fundamental law reflects the common aspiration of the entire Xi Jinping in 2016 Image: VOA. Communist Party of China and all Chinese people of various ethnic groups\". News media reported a backlash to the news on the Internet. In response, state censors were blocking images of Winnie the Pooh and words like \"I disagree\" and \"Emperor\". Reuters reported difficulties in getting reactions to the lifting of term limits from members of the congress, one woman choosing to remain anonymous and remarking, \"You can't ask me that\". Under China's constitution, the presidency is a largely ceremonial office with limited powers. However, since 1993, as a matter of convention, the presidency has been held simultaneously by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Chin,a the top leader in the one-party communist state. Xi Jinping's powerful positions as General Secretary and Chairman of the Central Military Commission do not have any term limit.

According to authorities, Wong, a former Pathway resident, drove a rented car to the center Friday, March 9, and shortly after 10 AM local time (UTC-8), dressed in black and armed with a semi-automatic rifle, took five of the people at a leaving party hostage. The first call to the emergency 9-1-1 number was made at about 10:20. About ten minutes later, shots were heard, and a sheriff's deputy and Wong exchanged fire. Wong then shut himself in a room with three of the hostages. The campus was evacuated, but there was no further contact with Wong. A little before 6 PM, a video feed from a remote-controlled robot showed the four people in the room were probably dead. The three victims were all women. Christine Loeber, 48, was the executive director of the home. Jen Golick, 42, was its clinical director.

He had been in treatment at the center for about a year but had been expelled two weeks before the hostage-taking because knives were found in his possession. His brother Tyrone Lampkin told The Press Democrat, Wong had been angry and said he \"wanted to get back at them\", but what he had mentioned was to \"talk to them, yell at them, not to kill them\". The Board of Directors of The Pathway Home announced on Wednesday that it would suspend operations \"indefinitely\".
